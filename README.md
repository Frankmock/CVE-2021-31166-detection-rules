# Zeek

## Features
- Detection when the CVE-2021-31166 vulnerability is being exploited.
- Detection if the 'exploited host' is down (this has a high threshold and may give some false negatives).
- Learn the hosts that may be vulnerable.

# Disclaimer
This is probably not a good rule to put into production, use it at your own risk.

I basically have no idea what I am doing.

Please send feedback if you have it.
